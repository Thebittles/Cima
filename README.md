## About
CIMA is an easy to use app that allows users to keep track of their daily symptoms, past and present treatments plans, and physician history to help alleviate the cognitive and emotional overload that comes with chronic illness. Our user dashboard shows pain averages and other symptom trends that show just how much your illness may be impacting your life. CIMAâ€™s goal is to empower women to find the best possible care for their reproductive health needs.

Through our user data we hope to help shorten time between first known symptom(s) and diagnosis, identify specific pelvic pain symptoms, and provide insights to health trends found in that data.
